# Create a dictionary

1. Choose a data structure for your dictionary
2. Implement the addEntry function to store items in the dictionary.
3. Implement a new function getEntry to return and entry given a new word it should return both the word and definition.
4. Implement a new function startsWith to return a new dictionary containing all the entries with the word starting with that string. It must be case insensitive.
5. Implement a new function groupByLength to return the words of the dictionary grouped by the length i.e.:

```json
  {
    "3": ["cat", "pen", "car"],
    "4": ["boat", "bike"],
    "5": ["Bruno"],
  }
```
